## 👋 Introduction

Memory serves as the cornerstone of foundation model-based agents, underpinning their ability to perform long-horizon reasoning, adapt continually, and interact effectively with complex environments.

Despite the explosion of research in this field, the landscape remains highly fragmented, with loosely defined terminologies and inconsistent taxonomies. This repository aims to bridge this gap. We distinguish Agent Memory from related concepts like RAG and Context Engineering, and provide a comprehensive overview through three unified lenses:

- Forms (What Carries Memory?): Categorizing memory by its storage medium—Token-level (explicit & discrete), Parametric (implicit weights), and Latent (hidden states) .
- Functions (Why Agents Need Memory?): Moving beyond simple temporal divisions to a functional taxonomy: Factual (knowledge), Experiential (insights & skills), and Working Memory (active context management) .
- Dynamics (How Memory Evolves?): Dissecting the operational lifecycle into Formation (extraction), Evolution (consolidation & forgetting), and Retrieval (access strategies) .

Through this structure, we hope to provide a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in future agentic intelligence.
